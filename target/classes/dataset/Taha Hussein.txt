Taha Hussein was born in Izbet el Kilo, a village in the Minya Governorate in central Upper Egypt.[1] He was 
the seventh of thirteen children of lower middle class parents.[1] He contracted ophthalmia at the 
age of two, and as the result of false 
treatment by an unskilled practitioner, he became blind.[6][7] 
After attending a kuttab, he studied religion and Arabic literature at El Azhar University;
 but from an early age, he was dissatisfied with the traditional education system.

When the secular Cairo University was founded in 1908, he was keen to be admitted, and despite 
being poor and blind, he won a place. In 1914, he received a PhD for his thesis on the sceptic poet and
 philosopher Abu al-ʿAlaʾ al-Maʿarri.[6]
