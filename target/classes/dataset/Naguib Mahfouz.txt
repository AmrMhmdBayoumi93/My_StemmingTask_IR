Mahfouz was born in a lower middle-class Muslim Egyptian family in Old Cairo in 1911. The first 
part of his compound given name was chosen in appreciation of the well-known obstetrician,
 Naguib Pasha Mahfouz, who oversaw his difficult birth.[3] Mahfouz was the seventh and the 
youngest child, with four brothers and two sisters, all of them much older than him. 
(Experientially, he grew up an "only child.") The family lived in two popular districts of Cairo: first,
 in the Bayt al-Qadi neighborhood in the Gamaleya quarter in the old city, from where they moved in 1924 to
 Abbaseya, then a new Cairo suburb north of the old city, locations that would provide the backdrop for many 
of Mahfouz's later writings. His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been "old-fashioned", 
was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934. Mahfouz's mother, Fatimah, was the 
daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an Al-Azhar sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous 
excursions to cultural locations such as the Egyptian Museum and the Pyramids.[4]

The Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing. In an interview, 
he elaborated on the stern religious climate at home during his childhood. He stated,
 "You would never have thought that an artist would emerge from that family."[4]

The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time 
only seven years old. From the window he saw British soldiers firing at the demonstrators in an 
effort to disperse them.[5] According to Mahfouz, "You could say ... that the one thing which 
most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution", he later said.[citation needed]

In his early years, Mahfouz read extensively and was influenced by Hafiz Najib,
 Taha Hussein and Salama Moussa, the Fabian intellectual.[6]

After completing his secondary education, Mahfouz was admitted in 1930 to the Egyptian
 University (now Cairo University), where he studied philosophy, graduating in 1934. By 1936,
 having spent a year working on an M.A. in philosophy, he decided to discontinue his studies 
and become a professional writer. He published his first work in Al Majalla Al Jadida, a magazine 
started by Salama Musa in 1929.[7] Mahfouz then worked as a journalist for Arrissalah, and contributed 
short stories to Al-Hilal and Al-Ahram.[8]
